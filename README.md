## Methodology
I went into this project with the words 'light' and 'extensible' in mind. For this reason I chose to build this application in VueJS. This is actually my first time using Vue. I heard that it had a much lighter foot print than framworks like React, and I wanted a solution that could let me bind elements and attributes to the DOM without a lot of code bloat. For my bundling and preprocessing I used Webpack because of its dependancy graphs.

After looking into Vue, I decided on a simpler project structure where I could place all most of the functionality as components and nest certain components within each other. Using this method I was able to quickly put together this project with efficient data binding, a callback, and not much code.
